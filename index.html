        I'm a web developer currently studying the full-stack web development
        bootcamp at Thinkful. I love coding because of the unlimited potential
        to develop life changing products that help shape our world.

        My favorite things are hiking up mountains, listening to records, going
        on road trips, and eating popcorn mixed with chocolate at the movies.

          As we increasingly get our news from digital media sources, it is important to be aware of the role that bias plays in what we're reading. I know for myself and many others, we tend to only read news from sources that align with where we are on the political spectrum. I created this app that shows you how stories are reported on across conservative, liberal, and neutral news outlets. 
          This will show how stories are reported on from different viewpoints. This app was built with
          React, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and uses The Currents API.

          During the Coronavirus pandemic, I was having virtual movie night
          parties with friends. One problem we kept having was trying to decide
          what to watch amongst the group. I decided to create this app that
          will allow everyone in the group to vote for their choice. The app
          will show you which movie got the most votes. You can also create
          lists for different nights/groups of friends. This app was built with
          React, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and uses The Movie Database API.
